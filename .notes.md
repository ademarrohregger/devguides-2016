## Annotations

These will (eventually) be parsed to a different presentation.

- `// ...` - collapse this line
- `// ^--^` - underlines the upper text
- `//@` - highlight line
- `// <--` - comment on this line
- `/*...*/` - snipping code that's not important
- `/*[ hello ]*/` - annotations
- `> â†³` - caption of a figure
- `#####` (h5) - the title of the figure
