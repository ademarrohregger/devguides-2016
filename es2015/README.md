# ES2015

So you know JavaScript, but you're still unsure of what's new in ES2015.

ES2015, previously called ES6, is the new version of JavaScript. It's supported by Node.js and modern browsers. Older browsers such as IE and iOS Safari will have to rely on [Babel](http://babeljs.io), a compiler that converts ES2015 to ES5 code.

Prior to ES2015, the latest version of JavaScript is ES5, which is what most people are familiar with.
