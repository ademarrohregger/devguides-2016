# Pocket Explainer

Let me try to explain complicated things in simple ways. Every guide here follows a golden rule: every page must fit in a pocket-sized note. Great for viewing on mobile!

## Let's learn

* __[Redux](redux/README.md)__
* __[ES2015](es2015/README.md)__
* _...more to come soon!_

_This is a big work-in-progress. Many sections haven't been written yet._

## Thanks
